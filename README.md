# dotfiles

## Apps

This is my personal configuration for desktop environment. It contains configuration for such applications as:

1. Tmux
2. Zsh
3. Xmonad

I use Xmonad as a wm inside xfce4, and it requires some additional xfce4 setup to work properly.

## Setup process

Clone this repo into user-space directory (eg. `~/dotfiles`). Run `setup.sh` to symlink config files into your home directory
